# React Vitest Crash Course

- Everything you need to know for react testing with vitest.
- All documented notes, syntax and matchers I have taken is here.

## Where to Begin
- If you havent had experience with the JavaScript version of Vitest testing, I would recommend learning that first from here: https://github.com/LakBud/vitest-unit-testing-playground
- If you have done that, then I would start this course with setting up the vitest.config.js file, package-lock configuration and getting vitest test servers to run before starting.

## Licence:

- Its open-source. You can use it however way you want to use it for.
